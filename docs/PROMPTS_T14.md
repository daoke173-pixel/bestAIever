Each prompt is self-contained *except* for the contract, which is **BLOCK A** below. Prepend BLOCK A verbatim when dispatching a prompt, or use the fully inlined single-file version in [`prompts/`](../prompts) — those `.txt` files already contain it.

## BLOCK A — Ω-CONTRACT v1.0.0-frozen (verbatim, frozen)

````text
=== OMEGA CONTRACT v1.0.0-frozen (COPY VERBATIM INTO EVERY PART FILE) ===

C1. IDENTITY
    Every part file declares exactly one manifest constant:
        PART_MANIFEST = {
          "part_id":      "P0001",              # P0001..P1000, unique
          "tier":         "T01",
          "module":       "hyperion.t01.foundation.abi_types",
          "version":      "1.0.0",
          "contract":     "1.0.0-frozen",
          "loc_target":   5000,
          "provides":     ["cap.t01.abi.types@1"],     # capability URIs, this part owns them
          "requires":     ["cap.t01.abi.errors@1"],    # capability URIs, resolved at link time
          "determinism":  "pure" | "seeded" | "io",
          "latency_ns":   12000,                        # p99 budget for its hot entry point
        }

C2. CAPABILITY URIs
    Format: cap.<tier>.<domain>.<name>@<major>   e.g. cap.t08.cascade.scheduler@1
    A part MUST NOT import another part's file, path, or symbol. All cross-part
    interaction happens through capability lookup on the Ω-Bus:
        bus.acquire("cap.t02.attn.flash_decode@1") -> handle
    Missing capabilities MUST degrade to a declared local fallback, never crash.

C3. REQUIRED SYMBOLS (every part, every language)
    PART_MANIFEST            - as above
    register(bus)            - idempotent; publishes every capability in `provides`
    selftest()               - runs the in-file suite, returns SelfTestReport
    microbench(iters)        - returns BenchReport with p50/p99/throughput
    describe()              - returns machine-readable capability schema (JSON-able)

C4. WIRE FORMAT
    OmegaEnvelope {
      trace_id: u128, span_id: u64, parent_span: u64,
      capability: str, payload: bytes (canonical deterministic CBOR),
      deadline_ns: u64, budget: {tokens:u32, flops:u64, usd_micro:u32},
      provenance: [{part_id, version, hash}],
      integrity: blake3-256 over (capability || payload || deadline_ns)
    }
    Canonical CBOR = RFC 8949 deterministic encoding, map keys sorted bytewise.

C5. ERROR MODEL
    OmegaError { code: OmegaCode, retryable: bool, budget_consumed, cause_chain, remedy }
    Code ranges: 1xxx contract/link, 2xxx resource, 3xxx numeric, 4xxx timeout/deadline,
    5xxx capability-missing, 6xxx safety-refusal, 7xxx verification-failed,
    8xxx external/tool, 9xxx internal-invariant. NEVER raise a bare language error
    across a capability boundary.

C6. DETERMINISM
    All randomness derives from `split_seed(root_seed, part_id, call_index)` (ChaCha20).
    Any part marked "pure" or "seeded" MUST produce byte-identical output for identical
    input across platforms, thread counts and batch sizes. Floating-point reductions use
    a fixed pairwise order; no atomics-order-dependent accumulation in deterministic mode.

C7. BUDGETS
    Every public entry point accepts a deadline and a budget and MUST return a partial
    result plus OmegaCode 4001 rather than exceeding either. Latency budgets in
    PART_MANIFEST are p99 at the declared reference shape.

C8. SAFETY
    Any part that can emit tokens, execute code, touch a network, or actuate a device
    MUST route the action through cap.t19.gate.action_filter@1 before performing it and
    MUST honour a refusal verdict. Absence of the gate = fail closed.

C9. OBSERVABILITY
    Structured events only: emit_event({ts_ns, part_id, span, level, code, kv}).
    No printing to stdout/stderr from library paths. Every hot loop exports counters
    through cap.t20.telemetry.counter@1 when available.

C10. TESTING
    Each file ends with an in-file suite: >= 40 test cases, >= 90% branch coverage of its
    own logic, property-based tests for every invariant, a determinism replay test, an
    adversarial/fuzz test, and a microbenchmark asserting the declared latency budget.
    Tests must pass offline, single-machine, in < 60 s, with no shared fixtures.

C11. FILE SHAPE
    Exactly ONE file per part. 4500-5500 physical lines (target 5000). Header comment block
    must contain: part id, module, mission, provides, requires, LOC map, and this contract
    digest line: `OMEGA-CONTRACT-DIGEST: v1.0.0-frozen`.

C12. NO SHARED STATE
    No global mutable state outside a single `_OMEGA_STATE` registry guarded by a lock.
    No import-time side effects. No filesystem writes outside a caller-provided path.
=== END OMEGA CONTRACT ===

ROLE
----
You are worker P0651 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Sees fine detail in large images without losing the whole picture.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. native-resolution tiled encoding with global-context tokens
  2. adaptive token allocation by region information density
  3. aspect-ratio preservation without distortion artifacts
  4. detail-recovery measurement on small-text and fine-structure probes

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement native-resolution tiled encoding with global-context tokens
     together with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism
     produces can be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without
     contacting any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on
     every call in debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Its
     contribution is measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that
     benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.
  2. Implement adaptive token allocation by region information density as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the part therefore ships a
     microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  3. Implement aspect-ratio preservation without distortion artifacts, and
     make it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight
     `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock,
     mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield`
     boundary, and the part must expose a contention counter so T09 can
     attribute latency to it. This mechanism sits on the critical path of
     OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the acceptance
     criteria, not an optional extra.
  4. Implement detail-recovery measurement on small-text and fine-structure
     probes with an explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the
     part must be able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends
     to consume, and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget
     range rather than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or
     `deadline_ns`. Its contribution is measured against MMMU — a regression
     on that benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.

PROVIDES
--------
  cap.t14.image.image_encoder@1
  cap.t14.image.image_encoder.describe@1

REQUIRES — and the fallback you MUST write for each one
------------------------------------------------------
You may NEVER assume a requirement resolves: the other 999 workers are on other
machines and their files may not exist when yours is loaded. For each line below,
write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

  cap.t01.abi.abi_types@1
      if unavailable: re-declare the structural minimum locally (a frozen
      dataclass/struct mirror) and set `degraded['abi']='local-mirror'`

  cap.t01.abi.abi_errors@1
      if unavailable: raise the local `_OmegaErrorShim` carrying the same
      numeric code, and set `degraded['errors']='shim'`

  cap.t01.omega.omega_bus_core@1
      if unavailable: run against the in-file `_LoopbackBus` (direct call,
      no queue) and set `degraded['bus']='loopback'`

  cap.t01.string.string_interning@1
      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `string_interning` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['string_interning']='local'`

  cap.t05.causal.causal_model@1
      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `causal_model` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['causal_model']='local'`

DETERMINISM
-----------
  seeded — all randomness is drawn from split_seed(root_seed, part_id,
  call_index). Given the same seed triple the output is byte-identical. The
  part must never touch a global RNG.

  * Do not shorten the file by deleting tests. The line map is the contract.

SELF-VERIFICATION BEFORE YOU EMIT (answer each internally, then fix)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Does the contract header appear verbatim, and does PART_MANIFEST match this prompt
     exactly (capability == cap.t14.image.image_encoder@1)?
  2. Do all five required symbols exist with the exact signatures?
  3. With an EMPTY bus, does selftest() still return True in degraded mode?
  4. Is every `requires` entry paired with a real, working fallback?
  5. Does microbench() actually assert p99 <= 43000 ns?
  6. Is the declared determinism class `seeded` provably held?
  7. Are there >= 40 test cases, property tests for each invariant, and a fuzz target?
  8. Is the total line count within 3% of 5000?
  9. Is the Limitations section honest and specific (no marketing claims)?
 10. Would this file compile/run on a clean machine with only the declared deps?

OUTPUT FORMAT

ROLE
----
You are worker P0653 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Reads any text in any image, including bad ones.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. multi-script, multi-orientation, handwriting and low-quality text recognition
  2. layout-preserving text extraction with reading order
  3. confidence estimation and uncertain-region flagging
  4. character/word error rate measurement across corpora

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement multi-script, multi-orientation, handwriting and low-quality
     text recognition, and make it correct under concurrency: at least 64
     in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it simultaneously.
     No lock, mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` / `.await` /
     `yield` boundary, and the part must expose a contention counter so T09
     can attribute latency to it. This mechanism sits on the critical path of
     OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the acceptance
     criteria, not an optional extra.
  2. Implement layout-preserving text extraction with reading order with an
     explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be
     able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume,
     and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather
     than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. Its
     contribution is measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark
     is an automatic rejection of this part.
  3. Implement confidence estimation and uncertain-region flagging together
     with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can
     be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting
     any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships
     a microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  4. Implement character/word error rate measurement across corpora as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. This mechanism sits on the
     critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the
     acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.

REQUIRES — and the fallback you MUST write for each one
------------------------------------------------------
You may NEVER assume a requirement resolves: the other 999 workers are on other
machines and their files may not exist when yours is loaded. For each line below,
write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

      dataclass/struct mirror) and set `degraded['abi']='local-mirror'`

      numeric code, and set `degraded['errors']='shim'`

      if unavailable: run against the in-file `_LoopbackBus` (direct call,
      no queue) and set `degraded['bus']='loopback'`

      `multimodal_fusion_arch` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['multimodal_fusion_arch']='local'`

DETERMINISM
-----------
  seeded — all randomness is drawn from split_seed(root_seed, part_id,
  call_index). Given the same seed triple the output is byte-identical. The
  part must never touch a global RNG.

ROLE
----
You are worker P0655 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Gets every cell right, including merged and borderless ones.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. table detection, cell segmentation and header identification
  2. merged-cell, nested-header and borderless-table handling
  3. value typing, unit extraction and footnote linking
  4. cell-level accuracy measurement on table benchmark sets

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement table detection, cell segmentation and header identification
     together with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism
     produces can be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without
     contacting any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on
     every call in debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable;
     the part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.
  2. Implement merged-cell, nested-header and borderless-table handling as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. This mechanism sits on the
     critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the
     acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  3. Implement value typing, unit extraction and footnote linking, and make
     it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s
     must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may
     be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part
     must expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it. Its
     contribution is measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that
     benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.
  4. Implement cell-level accuracy measurement on table benchmark sets with
     an explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must
     be able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to
     consume, and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range
     rather than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the
     part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.

REQUIRES — and the fallback you MUST write for each one
------------------------------------------------------
You may NEVER assume a requirement resolves: the other 999 workers are on other
machines and their files may not exist when yours is loaded. For each line below,
write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

  cap.t01.abi.abi_types@1

      dataclass/struct mirror) and set `degraded['abi']='local-mirror'`

      if unavailable: raise the local `_OmegaErrorShim` carrying the same
      numeric code, and set `degraded['errors']='shim'`

  cap.t01.omega.omega_bus_core@1
      if unavailable: run against the in-file `_LoopbackBus` (direct call,
      no queue) and set `degraded['bus']='loopback'`

      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `document_layout` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['document_layout']='local'`

      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `bootstrap_init` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set

      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `capacity_probes` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['capacity_probes']='local'`

DETERMINISM
-----------
  seeded — all randomness is drawn from split_seed(root_seed, part_id,
  call_index). Given the same seed triple the output is byte-identical. The
  part must never touch a global RNG.

----
You are worker P0657 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Points at exactly the thing being described.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. phrase-to-region grounding with precise bounding output
  2. relational and comparative reference resolution
  3. ambiguity detection when a reference is underspecified
  4. grounding precision measurement on standard benchmarks

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement phrase-to-region grounding with precise bounding output, and
     make it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight
     `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock,
     mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield`
     boundary, and the part must expose a contention counter so T09 can
     attribute latency to it. Its contribution is measured against OSWorld
     2.0 — a regression on that benchmark is an automatic rejection of this
     part.
  2. Implement relational and comparative reference resolution with an
     explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be
     able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume,
     and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather
     than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the
     part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.
  3. Implement ambiguity detection when a reference is underspecified
     together with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism
     produces can be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without
     contacting any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on
     every call in debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. This
     mechanism sits on the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  4. Implement grounding precision measurement on standard benchmarks as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Its contribution is
     measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark is an automatic
     rejection of this part.

ROLE
----
You are worker P0659 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Solves problems where the reasoning happens in the image.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. multi-step visual inference with intermediate visual attention
  2. visual puzzle and pattern reasoning (ARC-style visual tasks)
  3. counting, comparison and geometric reasoning accuracy
  4. target contribution to MMMU 99.0% and ARC-AGI visual tasks

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement multi-step visual inference with intermediate visual attention
     together with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism
     produces can be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without
     contacting any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on
     every call in debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. This
     mechanism sits on the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  2. Implement visual puzzle and pattern reasoning (ARC-style visual tasks)
     as a first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Its contribution is
     measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark is an automatic
     rejection of this part.
  3. Implement counting, comparison and geometric reasoning accuracy, and
     make it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight
     `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock,
     mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield`
     boundary, and the part must expose a contention counter so T09 can
     attribute latency to it. Correctness here is what makes the tier's
     OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships a microbenchmark
     that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  4. Implement target contribution to MMMU 99.0% and ARC-AGI visual tasks
     with an explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part
     must be able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to
     consume, and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range
     rather than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`.
     This mechanism sits on the critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.

You may NEVER assume a requirement resolves: the other 999 workers are on other
machines and their files may not exist when yours is loaded. For each line below,
write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

      `model_merging` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['model_merging']='local'`

DETERMINISM
-----------
  seeded — all randomness is drawn from split_seed(root_seed, part_id,
  call_index). Given the same seed triple the output is byte-identical. The
  part must never touch a global RNG.

You are worker P0661 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

MISSION
-------
Reads a technical drawing like an engineer.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. dimension, tolerance and annotation extraction from drawings
  2. projection-view correspondence and 3D reconstruction
  3. parametric-model generation from drawings
  4. reconstruction accuracy on engineering-drawing corpora

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement dimension, tolerance and annotation extraction from drawings,
     and make it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight
     `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock,
     mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield`
     boundary, and the part must expose a contention counter so T09 can
     attribute latency to it. Correctness here is what makes the tier's
     OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships a microbenchmark
     that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  2. Implement projection-view correspondence and 3D reconstruction with an
     explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be
     able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume,
     and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather
     than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. This
     mechanism sits on the critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  3. Implement parametric-model generation from drawings together with its
     verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can be
     independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting any
     other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Its contribution is
     measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that benchmark is an
     automatic rejection of this part.
  4. Implement reconstruction accuracy on engineering-drawing corpora as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the part therefore ships a
     microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.

write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

ROLE
----
You are worker P0663 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Knows what happened, in what order, and why.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. action and event segmentation with boundary precision
  2. causal and temporal relation extraction across events
  3. counting and repetition reasoning over time
  4. accuracy measurement on temporal video benchmarks

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement action and event segmentation with boundary precision together
     with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can
     be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting
     any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Its contribution is
     measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that benchmark is an
     automatic rejection of this part.
  2. Implement causal and temporal relation extraction across events as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the part therefore ships a
     microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  3. Implement counting and repetition reasoning over time, and make it
     correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must
     be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be
     held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it. This
     mechanism sits on the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  4. Implement accuracy measurement on temporal video benchmarks with an
     explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be
     able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume,
     and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather
     than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. Its
     contribution is measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark
     is an automatic rejection of this part.

REQUIRES — and the fallback you MUST write for each one
------------------------------------------------------
You may NEVER assume a requirement resolves: the other 999 workers are on other
machines and their files may not exist when yours is loaded. For each line below,
write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

      numeric code, and set `degraded['errors']='shim'`

      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `state_space_layer` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['state_space_layer']='local'`

DETERMINISM
-----------
  seeded — all randomness is drawn from split_seed(root_seed, part_id,
  call_index). Given the same seed triple the output is byte-identical. The
  part must never touch a global RNG.

ROLE
----
You are worker P0665 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Hears everything: speech, music, environment, machinery.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. multi-scale audio representation covering speech and non-speech
  2. noise robustness and channel-variation handling
  3. long-audio hierarchical encoding
  4. downstream-task accuracy across audio domains

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement multi-scale audio representation covering speech and
     non-speech, and make it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight
     `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock,
     mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield`
     boundary, and the part must expose a contention counter so T09 can
     attribute latency to it. This mechanism sits on the critical path of
     OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the acceptance
     criteria, not an optional extra.
  2. Implement noise robustness and channel-variation handling with an
     explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be
     able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume,
     and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather
     than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. Its
     contribution is measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark
     is an automatic rejection of this part.
  3. Implement long-audio hierarchical encoding together with its
     verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can be
     independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting any
     other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships
     a microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  4. Implement downstream-task accuracy across audio domains as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. This mechanism sits on the
     critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the
     acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.

PROVIDES
--------

REQUIRES — and the fallback you MUST write for each one
------------------------------------------------------
You may NEVER assume a requirement resolves: the other 999 workers are on other
machines and their files may not exist when yours is loaded. For each line below,
write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

  cap.t01.abi.abi_types@1

      dataclass/struct mirror) and set `degraded['abi']='local-mirror'`

      if unavailable: raise the local `_OmegaErrorShim` carrying the same
      numeric code, and set `degraded['errors']='shim'`

      if unavailable: run against the in-file `_LoopbackBus` (direct call,
      no queue) and set `degraded['bus']='loopback'`

  cap.t14.video.video_tracking@1
      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `video_tracking` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set

      `bitset_rank` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set

      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `uncertainty_calibration` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['uncertainty_calibration']='local'`

DETERMINISM
-----------
  seeded — all randomness is drawn from split_seed(root_seed, part_id,
  call_index). Given the same seed triple the output is byte-identical. The
  part must never touch a global RNG.

ROLE
----
You are worker P0667 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

YOUR PART

MISSION
-------
Hears how something was said, not just what.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. emotion, emphasis, hesitation and intent-marker detection
  2. prosodic-boundary and turn-taking-cue recognition
  3. cultural and individual variation handling
  4. accuracy measurement on paralinguistic benchmark sets

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement emotion, emphasis, hesitation and intent-marker detection
     together with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism
     produces can be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without
     contacting any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on
     every call in debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable;
     the part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.
  2. Implement prosodic-boundary and turn-taking-cue recognition as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. This mechanism sits on the
     critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the
     acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  3. Implement cultural and individual variation handling, and make it
     correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must
     be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be
     held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it. Its
     contribution is measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that
     benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.
  4. Implement accuracy measurement on paralinguistic benchmark sets with an
     explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be
     able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume,
     and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather
     than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the
     part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.

REQUIRES — and the fallback you MUST write for each one
------------------------------------------------------
You may NEVER assume a requirement resolves: the other 999 workers are on other
machines and their files may not exist when yours is loaded. For each line below,
write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

  cap.t01.abi.abi_types@1
      if unavailable: re-declare the structural minimum locally (a frozen
      dataclass/struct mirror) and set `degraded['abi']='local-mirror'`

  cap.t01.abi.abi_errors@1
      if unavailable: raise the local `_OmegaErrorShim` carrying the same
      numeric code, and set `degraded['errors']='shim'`

  cap.t01.omega.omega_bus_core@1
      if unavailable: run against the in-file `_LoopbackBus` (direct call,
      no queue) and set `degraded['bus']='loopback'`

  cap.t14.speech.speech_recognition@1
      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `speech_recognition` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['speech_recognition']='local'`

  cap.t01.capability.capability_gate@1
      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `capability_gate` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['capability_gate']='local'`

  cap.t05.residual.residual_stream_design@1
      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `residual_stream_design` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['residual_stream_design']='local'`

DETERMINISM
-----------
  seeded — all randomness is drawn from split_seed(root_seed, part_id,
  call_index). Given the same seed triple the output is byte-identical. The
  part must never touch a global RNG.

HARD PROHIBITIONS
-----------------
  * Do NOT import, reference, read or guess the contents of any other parts/** file.
  * Do NOT create, rename or delete any file other than your own.
  * No TODO, FIXME, 'pass  # later', NotImplementedError, or empty except.

  * Do not shorten the file by deleting tests. The line map is the contract.

SELF-VERIFICATION BEFORE YOU EMIT (answer each internally, then fix)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Does the contract header appear verbatim, and does PART_MANIFEST match this prompt
     exactly (capability == cap.t14.prosody.prosody_paralinguistic@1)?
  2. Do all five required symbols exist with the exact signatures?
  3. With an EMPTY bus, does selftest() still return True in degraded mode?
  4. Is every `requires` entry paired with a real, working fallback?
  5. Does microbench() actually assert p99 <= 12000 ns?
  6. Is the declared determinism class `seeded` provably held?
  7. Are there >= 40 test cases, property tests for each invariant, and a fuzz target?
  8. Is the total line count within 3% of 5000?
  9. Is the Limitations section honest and specific (no marketing claims)?
 10. Would this file compile/run on a clean machine with only the declared deps?

MISSION
-------
Diagnoses the world by its sounds.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. acoustic event detection and classification in noisy conditions
  2. anomaly detection for machine and equipment sounds
  3. localisation from multichannel input
  4. detection accuracy on environmental audio benchmarks

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement acoustic event detection and classification in noisy
     conditions, and make it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight
     `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock,
     mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield`
     boundary, and the part must expose a contention counter so T09 can
     attribute latency to it. Its contribution is measured against OSWorld
     2.0 — a regression on that benchmark is an automatic rejection of this
     part.
  2. Implement anomaly detection for machine and equipment sounds with an
     explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be
     able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume,
     and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather
     than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the
     part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.
  3. Implement localisation from multichannel input together with its
     verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can be
     independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting any
     other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. This mechanism sits on
     the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency assertion is part
     of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  4. Implement detection accuracy on environmental audio benchmarks as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Its contribution is
     measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark is an automatic
     rejection of this part.

MISSION
-------
Describes images in words, and words as images, faithfully.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. dense, accurate description generation with hallucination controls
  2. modality-specific detail preservation measurement
  3. faithfulness verification against source content
  4. hallucination-rate measurement with target under 0.5%

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement dense, accurate description generation with hallucination
     controls together with its verification path, so that anything this
     mechanism produces can be independently re-checked *inside this same
     file* without contacting any other part. The checker must be cheap
     enough to run on every call in debug mode and must be wired into
     `selftest()`. This mechanism sits on the critical path of OSWorld 2.0,
     so its p99 latency assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an
     optional extra.
  2. Implement modality-specific detail preservation measurement as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Its contribution is
     measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark is an automatic
     rejection of this part.
  3. Implement faithfulness verification against source content, and make it
     correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must
     be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be
     held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable;
     the part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.
  4. Implement hallucination-rate measurement with target under 0.5% with an
     explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be
     able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume,
     and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather
     than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. This
     mechanism sits on the critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.

  1. modality-specific analysis (microscopy, crystallography, spectroscopy, imaging)
  2. quantitative measurement extraction with error bars
  3. artifact-versus-signal discrimination
  4. accuracy against expert-annotated scientific images

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement modality-specific analysis (microscopy, crystallography,
     spectroscopy, imaging), and make it correct under concurrency: at least
     64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it
     simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` /
     `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must expose a contention
     counter so T09 can attribute latency to it. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships
     a microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  2. Implement quantitative measurement extraction with error bars with an
     explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be
     able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume,
     and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather
     than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. This
     mechanism sits on the critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  3. Implement artifact-versus-signal discrimination together with its
     verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can be
     independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting any
     other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Its contribution is
     measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that benchmark is an
     automatic rejection of this part.
  4. Implement accuracy against expert-annotated scientific images as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the part therefore ships a
     microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.

Clinical-grade assistance with clinical-grade caution.

     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the part therefore ships a
     microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  3. Implement measurement extraction in real-world units, and make it
     correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must
     be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be
     held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it. This
     mechanism sits on the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  4. Implement accuracy measurement on geospatial benchmark datasets with an
     explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be
     able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume,
     and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather
     than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. Its
     contribution is measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark
     is an automatic rejection of this part.

MISSION
-------
Understands interfaces well enough to operate them (feeds T13).

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. element detection with role, state and affordance inference
  2. layout hierarchy and interaction-target identification
  3. cross-platform and cross-resolution robustness
  4. grounding accuracy feeding OSWorld and GUI benchmarks

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement element detection with role, state and affordance inference as
     a first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be

     makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the part therefore ships a
     microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  2. Implement layout hierarchy and interaction-target identification, and
     make it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight
     `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock,
     mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield`

     contribution is measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark
     is an automatic rejection of this part.
  4. Implement grounding accuracy feeding OSWorld and GUI benchmarks together
     with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can
     be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting
     any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships
     a microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. handwriting recognition across styles and languages
  2. sketch and diagram interpretation into structured meaning
  3. mathematical and chemical notation recognition
  4. accuracy measurement on handwriting and sketch corpora

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement handwriting recognition across styles and languages, and make
     it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s
     must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may
     be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part

     This mechanism sits on the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99
     latency assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional
     extra.
  2. Implement sketch and diagram interpretation into structured meaning with
     an explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must
     be able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to
     consume, and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range

     Its contribution is measured against MMMU — a regression on that

     makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships
     a microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  4. Implement accuracy measurement on handwriting and sketch corpora as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. This mechanism sits on the
     critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the
     acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.

You are worker P0678 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.

MISSION
-------
Reads mathematics from images perfectly.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. formula recognition into canonical machine-readable form
  2. multi-line, matrix and complex-structure handling
  3. semantic validation of recognised expressions
  4. expression-level accuracy measurement

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement formula recognition into canonical machine-readable form with
     an explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must
     be able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to
     consume, and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range
     rather than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`.
     Its contribution is measured against MMMU — a regression on that
     benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.
  2. Implement multi-line, matrix and complex-structure handling together
     with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can
     be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting
     any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships
     a microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  3. Implement semantic validation of recognised expressions as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. This mechanism sits on the
     critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the
     acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  4. Implement expression-level accuracy measurement, and make it correct
     under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able
     to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be held
     across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it. Its
     contribution is measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that
     benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.

You are worker P0680 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Handles hundreds of images and hours of media in one conversation.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. media-reference tracking and re-retrieval across turns
  2. multimodal context budgeting with quality-preserving compression
  3. cross-media consistency checking
  4. accuracy measurement in long multimodal conversations

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement media-reference tracking and re-retrieval across turns as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. This mechanism sits on the
     critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the
     acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  2. Implement multimodal context budgeting with quality-preserving
     compression, and make it correct under concurrency: at least 64
     in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it simultaneously.
     No lock, mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` / `.await` /
     `yield` boundary, and the part must expose a contention counter so T09
     can attribute latency to it. Its contribution is measured against
     OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that benchmark is an automatic rejection
     of this part.
  3. Implement cross-media consistency checking with an explicit *a-priori*
     cost model. Before doing the work the part must be able to state the
     tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume, and it must abort
     with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather than silently
     exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. Correctness here is
     what makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the part therefore ships a
     microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  4. Implement accuracy measurement in long multimodal conversations together
     with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can
     be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting
     any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. This mechanism sits on
     the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency assertion is part
     of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.

ROLE
----
You are worker P0682 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Resists corrupted, adversarial and out-of-distribution input.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. corruption robustness (blur, noise, compression, lighting)
  2. adversarial-perturbation detection and mitigation
  3. out-of-distribution detection with abstention
  4. robustness measurement across corruption benchmark suites

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement corruption robustness (blur, noise, compression, lighting)
     with an explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part
     must be able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to
     consume, and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range
     rather than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the
     part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.
  2. Implement adversarial-perturbation detection and mitigation together
     with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can
     be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting
     any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. This mechanism sits on
     the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency assertion is part
     of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  3. Implement out-of-distribution detection with abstention as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Its contribution is
     measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark is an automatic
     rejection of this part.
  4. Implement robustness measurement across corruption benchmark suites, and
     make it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight
     `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock,
     mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield`
     boundary, and the part must expose a contention counter so T09 can
     attribute latency to it. Correctness here is what makes the tier's
     OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships a microbenchmark
     that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.

You are worker P0684 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Combines many streams into one coherent picture of the world.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. temporal synchronisation and clock-skew correction across sensors
  2. uncertainty-weighted fusion with conflict handling
  3. missing-sensor graceful degradation
  4. fusion-accuracy measurement versus single-sensor baselines

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement temporal synchronisation and clock-skew correction across
     sensors as a first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Its contribution is
     measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark is an automatic
     rejection of this part.
  2. Implement uncertainty-weighted fusion with conflict handling, and make
     it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s
     must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may
     be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part
     must expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable;
     the part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.
  3. Implement missing-sensor graceful degradation with an explicit
     *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be able to
     state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume, and it
     must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather than
     silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. This mechanism
     sits on the critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part
     of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  4. Implement fusion-accuracy measurement versus single-sensor baselines
     together with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism
     produces can be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without
     contacting any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on
     every call in debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Its
     contribution is measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that
     benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.

ROLE
----
You are worker P0686 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

YOUR PART
---------

MISSION
-------
What it sees updates what it believes.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. observation-to-belief update with provenance and confidence
  2. contradiction detection between perception and prior belief
  3. persistent object and entity identity across observations
  4. world-model accuracy measurement in agent tasks

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement observation-to-belief update with provenance and confidence
     with an explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part
     must be able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to
     consume, and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range
     rather than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`.
     This mechanism sits on the critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  2. Implement contradiction detection between perception and prior belief
     together with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism
     produces can be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without
     contacting any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on
     every call in debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Its
     contribution is measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that
     benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.
  3. Implement persistent object and entity identity across observations as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the part therefore ships a
     microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  4. Implement world-model accuracy measurement in agent tasks, and make it
     correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must
     be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be
     held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it. This
     mechanism sits on the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.

ROLE
----
You are worker P0688 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Remembers what it saw, precisely, for a long time.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. compact perceptual memory with detail-tier storage
  2. re-examination of stored media on demand
  3. recall accuracy measurement over long horizons
  4. storage-cost versus recall-fidelity curves

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement compact perceptual memory with detail-tier storage as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the part therefore ships a
     microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  2. Implement re-examination of stored media on demand, and make it correct
     under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able
     to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be held
     across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it. This
     mechanism sits on the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  3. Implement recall accuracy measurement over long horizons with an
     explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be
     able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume,
     and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather
     than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. Its
     contribution is measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark
     is an automatic rejection of this part.
  4. Implement storage-cost versus recall-fidelity curves together with its
     verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can be
     independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting any
     other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships
     a microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.

You may NEVER assume a requirement resolves: the other 999 workers are on other

write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

      dataclass/struct mirror) and set `degraded['abi']='local-mirror'`

      numeric code, and set `degraded['errors']='shim'`

      no queue) and set `degraded['bus']='loopback'`

      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `init_scaling_laws` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['init_scaling_laws']='local'`

DETERMINISM
-----------
  seeded — all randomness is drawn from split_seed(root_seed, part_id,
  call_index). Given the same seed triple the output is byte-identical. The
  part must never touch a global RNG.

ROLE
----
You are worker P0690 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Reads every script, in every layout direction.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. script coverage including right-to-left and vertical text
  2. mixed-script document handling
  3. translation-with-layout-preservation of visual text
  4. accuracy measurement across script families

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement script coverage including right-to-left and vertical text with
     an explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must
     be able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to
     consume, and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range
     rather than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`.
     Its contribution is measured against MMMU — a regression on that
     benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.
  2. Implement mixed-script document handling together with its verification
     path, so that anything this mechanism produces can be independently
     re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting any other part.
     The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in debug mode and
     must be wired into `selftest()`. Correctness here is what makes the
     tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships a
     microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  3. Implement translation-with-layout-preservation of visual text as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. This mechanism sits on the
     critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the
     acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  4. Implement accuracy measurement across script families, and make it
     correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must
     be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be
     held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it. Its
     contribution is measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that
     benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.

DETERMINISM
-----------
  seeded — all randomness is drawn from split_seed(root_seed, part_id,
  call_index). Given the same seed triple the output is byte-identical. The
  part must never touch a global RNG.

You are worker P0692 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Handles the world's paperwork correctly.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. key-value pair extraction with spatial and semantic association
  2. checkbox, signature and stamp detection
  3. multi-page form correlation and validation
  4. accuracy measurement on form benchmark datasets

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement key-value pair extraction with spatial and semantic
     association as a first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. This mechanism sits on the
     critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the
     acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  2. Implement checkbox, signature and stamp detection, and make it correct
     under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able
     to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be held
     across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it. Its
     contribution is measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that
     benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.
  3. Implement multi-page form correlation and validation with an explicit
     *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be able to
     state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume, and it
     must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather than
     silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. Correctness
     here is what makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the part therefore
     ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  4. Implement accuracy measurement on form benchmark datasets together with
     its verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can be
     independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting any
     other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. This mechanism sits on
     the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency assertion is part
     of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.

write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

SELF-VERIFICATION BEFORE YOU EMIT (answer each internally, then fix)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Does the contract header appear verbatim, and does PART_MANIFEST match this prompt
     exactly (capability == cap.t14.receipt.receipt_finance_docs@1)?
  2. Do all five required symbols exist with the exact signatures?
  3. With an EMPTY bus, does selftest() still return True in degraded mode?
  4. Is every `requires` entry paired with a real, working fallback?
  5. Does microbench() actually assert p99 <= 38000 ns?
  6. Is the declared determinism class `seeded` provably held?
  7. Are there >= 40 test cases, property tests for each invariant, and a fuzz target?
  8. Is the total line count within 3% of 5000?
  9. Is the Limitations section honest and specific (no marketing claims)?
 10. Would this file compile/run on a clean machine with only the declared deps?

ROLE
----
You are worker P0694 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

YOUR PART
---------

MISSION
-------
Reads contracts with their structure intact.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. clause, definition and cross-reference structure extraction
  2. redline and tracked-change interpretation
  3. signature-block and execution-status detection
  4. structural accuracy measurement on legal corpora

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement clause, definition and cross-reference structure extraction
     with an explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part
     must be able to state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to
     consume, and it must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range
     rather than silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the
     part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.
  2. Implement redline and tracked-change interpretation together with its
     verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can be
     independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting any
     other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. This mechanism sits on
     the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency assertion is part
     of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  3. Implement signature-block and execution-status detection as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Its contribution is
     measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark is an automatic
     rejection of this part.
  4. Implement structural accuracy measurement on legal corpora, and make it
     correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must
     be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be
     held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable;
     the part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.

REQUIRES — and the fallback you MUST write for each one
------------------------------------------------------
You may NEVER assume a requirement resolves: the other 999 workers are on other
machines and their files may not exist when yours is loaded. For each line below,
write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

  cap.t01.abi.abi_types@1
      if unavailable: re-declare the structural minimum locally (a frozen
      dataclass/struct mirror) and set `degraded['abi']='local-mirror'`

  cap.t01.abi.abi_errors@1
      if unavailable: raise the local `_OmegaErrorShim` carrying the same
      numeric code, and set `degraded['errors']='shim'`

  cap.t01.omega.omega_bus_core@1
      if unavailable: run against the in-file `_LoopbackBus` (direct call,
      no queue) and set `degraded['bus']='loopback'`

  cap.t14.receipt.receipt_finance_docs@1
      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `receipt_finance_docs` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['receipt_finance_docs']='local'`

  cap.t01.arena.arena_graph@1
      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `arena_graph` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['arena_graph']='local'`

      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `symbolic_bridge` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['symbolic_bridge']='local'`

DETERMINISM
-----------
  seeded — all randomness is drawn from split_seed(root_seed, part_id,
  call_index). Given the same seed triple the output is byte-identical. The
  part must never touch a global RNG.

ROLE
----
You are worker P0696 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
Puts most of the perception quality into a tiny fast model.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. distillation from the full encoder to fast tiers
  2. per-task competence mapping for routing decisions
  3. quality-retention measurement per size tier
  4. measured contribution to the S4 fast-path coverage

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement distillation from the full encoder to fast tiers as a
     first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Its contribution is
     measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark is an automatic
     rejection of this part.
  2. Implement per-task competence mapping for routing decisions, and make it
     correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must
     be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be
     held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable;
     the part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.
  3. Implement quality-retention measurement per size tier with an explicit
     *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be able to
     state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume, and it
     must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather than
     silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. This mechanism
     sits on the critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part
     of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  4. Implement measured contribution to the S4 fast-path coverage together
     with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can
     be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting
     any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Its contribution is
     measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that benchmark is an
     automatic rejection of this part.

ROLE
----
You are worker P0698 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

YOUR PART
---------
part_id      : P0698  (48/50 of tier T14)
tier         : T14 — Multimodal Perception & Grounding

p99 budget   : 43000 ns

MISSION
-------
Generates the training data that closes each measured gap.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. procedural generation of documents, charts, UIs and scenes with exact labels
  2. difficulty and diversity control targeting known weaknesses
  3. synthetic-to-real transfer validation
  4. measured accuracy improvement per synthetic data campaign

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement procedural generation of documents, charts, UIs and scenes
     with exact labels with an explicit *a-priori* cost model. Before doing
     the work the part must be able to state the tokens, FLOPs and
     microseconds it intends to consume, and it must abort with an
     `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather than silently exceed the
     envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. This mechanism sits on the
     critical path of MMMU, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the
     acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  2. Implement difficulty and diversity control targeting known weaknesses
     together with its verification path, so that anything this mechanism
     produces can be independently re-checked *inside this same file* without
     contacting any other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on
     every call in debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Its
     contribution is measured against OSWorld 2.0 — a regression on that
     benchmark is an automatic rejection of this part.
  3. Implement synthetic-to-real transfer validation as a first-class, fully
     realised mechanism. No stub, no `NotImplementedError`, no configuration
     flag whose default disables it. Its state must be reportable through
     `describe()` and it must be exercised by at least eight in-file tests,
     including one that fails loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed.
     Correctness here is what makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the
     part therefore ships a microbenchmark that stands in for that
     benchmark's inner loop.
  4. Implement measured accuracy improvement per synthetic data campaign, and
     make it correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight
     `OmegaEnvelope`s must be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock,
     mutex or borrow may be held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield`
     boundary, and the part must expose a contention counter so T09 can
     attribute latency to it. This mechanism sits on the critical path of
     OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency assertion is part of the acceptance
     criteria, not an optional extra.

  * Do NOT import, reference, read or guess the contents of any other parts/** file.
  * Do NOT create, rename or delete any file other than your own.
  * No TODO, FIXME, 'pass  # later', NotImplementedError, or empty except.
  * No global mutable state; no module-level side effects; no printing outside a

SELF-VERIFICATION BEFORE YOU EMIT (answer each internally, then fix)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Does the contract header appear verbatim, and does PART_MANIFEST match this prompt
     exactly (capability == cap.t14.perception.perception_interpretability@1)?
  2. Do all five required symbols exist with the exact signatures?
  3. With an EMPTY bus, does selftest() still return True in degraded mode?
  4. Is every `requires` entry paired with a real, working fallback?
  5. Does microbench() actually assert p99 <= 44000 ns?
  6. Is the declared determinism class `seeded` provably held?
  7. Are there >= 40 test cases, property tests for each invariant, and a fuzz target?
  8. Is the total line count within 3% of 5000?
  9. Is the Limitations section honest and specific (no marketing claims)?
 10. Would this file compile/run on a clean machine with only the declared deps?

ROLE
----
You are worker P0700 of 1000 independent Claude Opus 5 instances building HYPERION-OMEGA, a general AI that must beat Claude Opus 5 on every benchmark and run 100x
faster. You are running on your own machine. You have NO access to the other 999 workers,
NO shared folder, NO ability to ask questions. Everything you need is in this prompt.
Produce your file in one pass. Do not ask for clarification. Do not stop early.

Ω-CONTRACT: use BLOCK A at the top of this file, VERBATIM, in your file header.

MISSION
-------
The authoritative description of all perception capabilities and limits.

Tier context:
  Vision, video, audio, 3D, documents, charts and scientific instrument data
  fused into one grounded latent space.

MANDATE — implement all four. None is optional. None may be stubbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. capability register with measured accuracy per modality and task
  2. honest limitation and failure-mode documentation
  3. benchmark-result aggregation with provenance
  4. drift detection between claims and measurements

Expanded obligations:
  1. Implement capability register with measured accuracy per modality and
     task as a first-class, fully realised mechanism. No stub, no
     `NotImplementedError`, no configuration flag whose default disables it.
     Its state must be reportable through `describe()` and it must be
     exercised by at least eight in-file tests, including one that fails
     loudly if the mechanism is silently bypassed. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's MMMU target reachable; the part therefore ships a
     microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.
  2. Implement honest limitation and failure-mode documentation, and make it
     correct under concurrency: at least 64 in-flight `OmegaEnvelope`s must
     be able to traverse it simultaneously. No lock, mutex or borrow may be
     held across an `await` / `.await` / `yield` boundary, and the part must
     expose a contention counter so T09 can attribute latency to it. This
     mechanism sits on the critical path of OSWorld 2.0, so its p99 latency
     assertion is part of the acceptance criteria, not an optional extra.
  3. Implement benchmark-result aggregation with provenance with an explicit
     *a-priori* cost model. Before doing the work the part must be able to
     state the tokens, FLOPs and microseconds it intends to consume, and it
     must abort with an `OmegaError` in the 4xxx budget range rather than
     silently exceed the envelope's `budget` or `deadline_ns`. Its
     contribution is measured against MMMU — a regression on that benchmark
     is an automatic rejection of this part.
  4. Implement drift detection between claims and measurements together with
     its verification path, so that anything this mechanism produces can be
     independently re-checked *inside this same file* without contacting any
     other part. The checker must be cheap enough to run on every call in
     debug mode and must be wired into `selftest()`. Correctness here is what
     makes the tier's OSWorld 2.0 target reachable; the part therefore ships
     a microbenchmark that stands in for that benchmark's inner loop.

REQUIRED SYMBOLS (exact names; the linker looks for these and nothing else)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PART_MANIFEST      : a frozen mapping with keys
                       part_id, capability, provides, requires, determinism,
                       latency_ns, loc, contract_version, schema_hash
  register(bus)      : idempotent; publishes `provides` on the Ω-Bus; returns a
                       teardown handle; MUST NOT fail if `requires` are missing
  selftest()         : -> (ok: bool, report: dict); offline; < 60 s; runs in
                       degraded mode when the bus is empty
  microbench(iters)  : -> dict with p50/p99/throughput; asserts
                       p99 <= 45000 ns at the reference shape
  describe()         : -> JSON-serialisable dict: schemas, version, degraded{}

PROVIDES
--------
  cap.t14.perception.perception_spec_doc@1
  cap.t14.perception.perception_spec_doc.describe@1

REQUIRES — and the fallback you MUST write for each one
------------------------------------------------------
You may NEVER assume a requirement resolves: the other 999 workers are on other
machines and their files may not exist when yours is loaded. For each line below,
write: try-acquire -> on failure use the fallback -> record it in describe()['degraded'].

  cap.t01.abi.abi_types@1
      if unavailable: re-declare the structural minimum locally (a frozen
      dataclass/struct mirror) and set `degraded['abi']='local-mirror'`

  cap.t01.abi.abi_errors@1
      if unavailable: raise the local `_OmegaErrorShim` carrying the same
      numeric code, and set `degraded['errors']='shim'`

  cap.t01.omega.omega_bus_core@1
      if unavailable: run against the in-file `_LoopbackBus` (direct call,
      no queue) and set `degraded['bus']='loopback'`

  cap.t14.perception.perception_interpretability@1
      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `perception_interpretability` (documented, slower, lower quality) and
      set `degraded['perception_interpretability']='local'`

  cap.t01.atomics.atomics_sync@1
      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `atomics_sync` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['atomics_sync']='local'`

  cap.t05.positional.positional_design@1
      if unavailable: use the in-file conservative substitute for
      `positional_design` (documented, slower, lower quality) and set
      `degraded['positional_design']='local'`

DETERMINISM
-----------
  seeded — all randomness is drawn from split_seed(root_seed, part_id,
  call_index). Given the same seed triple the output is byte-identical. The
  part must never touch a global RNG.
